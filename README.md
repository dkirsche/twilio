Twilio IVR Examples

Example 1
Twilio answers phone call plays an intro if during business hours it will forward call to an operator.
Operator answers call, but before connecting with caller has a chance to reject call. If rejected caller gets sent to vm.
If VM is created, an alert email is sent to company


Example 2
Much more complicated then example 1, incorporating a queue, and allows caller to dial an extension for a specific operator.
